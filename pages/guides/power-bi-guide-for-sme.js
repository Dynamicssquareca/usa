                <p>It's a fact that the world of today is different from the world before. This is the age of digital acceleration.</p>
                <p>Every enterprise, from <Link href="/free-dynamics-365-system-health-check/"><a>healthcare</a></Link>, remote work, economics, and education to the manufacturing sector is generating an incredible amount of data every day. This data in millions (or billions) disparate pieces of information is then visualized and used for informed decision-making; which means - decisions based on numbers and insights.</p>
                <p>Before data visualization techniques, people used to make decisions based on intuition - gut feeling, personal experiences - expert opinions, and limited information - historical data.</p>
                <p>This approach is subjective and lacks the rigor and impartiality of data-driven decision-making.</p>
                <p>With the advent of <b>data visualization tools</b> like <b>Power BI</b>, decision-making has become more informed and effective, leading to better results and improved performance.</p>
                <p>Business intelligence (BI) tools or data visualization tools like <Link href="/products/microsoft-power-bi/"><a>Microsoft Power BI</a></Link> are now integral for <b>small or medium-sized businesses</b>. These BI tools are transforming the way businesses make data-driven decisions.</p>
                <p>Because these tools have user-friendly interfaces and a wide range of features. <b>Microsoft's Power BI</b> has emerged as one of the most popular BI platforms on the market because of its faster data analysis capabilities and the ability to connect to various data sources.</p>
                <p>According to Gartner, about <b>83%</b> of all active users would recommend Power BI:</p>

               <p>Microsoft designed and developed <b>Power BI for helping businesses</b> with business intelligence (BI) capabilities.</p>
               <p>The innovative application of Power BI was first conceived by Ron George under the project name "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Power_BI#:~:text=It%20was%20originally%20designed%20by,Power%20BI%20for%20Office%20365." rel="nofollow" >Project Crescent</a>", back in 2011.

                <b className="h3">What are the components of Power BI?</b>
                </p>
                <p>Power BI enables organizations like yours to analyze and present data in an interactive and meaningful way. It offers a range of features including data connectors, data modeling, report and dashboard creation, and collaboration capabilities.</p>
                <p>Here are the components of Power BI that powers it:</p>
                <p>
                  <b>1. Power Query:</b>
                </p>
                <p>Power Query is a data transformation tool that enables users to find, refine, connect, and combine various data resources. It supports a wide range of database formats, including Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, and more.</p>
                <p>Power Query is integrated with Power BI Desktop and Excel for better data visualization.</p>
                <p>
                  <b>Power Pivot:</b>
                </p>
                <p>This is a data modeling engine that enables users to create data models, share insights, manage relationships, and perform calculations. It runs on DAX (Data Analysis Expression) to perform both simple and complex data calculations.</p>
                <p>
                  <b>3. Power View:</b>
                </p>
                <p>It is a feature that allows users to filter and present data in a visually appealing way, such as charts, graphs, bars, etc. Power View connects multiple data sources to enable data visualization. It is a standard feature of Microsoft, available in Power BI, <b>Excel</b>, SQL Server, and <b>SharePoint</b>.</p>
                <p>
                  <b>4. Power Map:</b>
                </p>
                <p>This Power BI feature uses <b>Bing Maps</b> (now driven by Microsoft's own artificial intelligence - AI) to create <b>3-D data visualization</b> and <b>mapping on Power BI and Excel</b>. It uses various location factors, such as latitude, longitude, street address, city, state, and country, to accurately display data in a 3D format.</p>
                <p>
                  <b>5. Power BI Desktop:</b>
                </p>
                <p>Power BI Desktop is the primary development application for creating <Link href="https://blog.dynamicssquare.com/power-bi-architecture-and-its-components-explained/"><a>Power BI Components</a></Link>, such as Power Query, <b>Power View</b>, and <b>Power Pivot</b>. It allows users to create BI reports and make changes to the data processing.</p>
                <p>
                  <b>6. Power BI Web:</b>
                </p>
                <p>Power BI Web is designed for <Link href="https://blog.dynamicssquare.com/small-business-leaders-need-power-bi/"><a>small and medium-sized businesses</a></Link>, allowing them to publish data directly on the Power BI website using a web browser.</p>
                <p>
                  <b>7. Power Q&A:</b>
                </p>
                <p>This feature of Power BI allows users to search for data or query the data using natural language (also termed natural language processing or <b>NLP</b> in the field of Data Science). This makes finding data easier by simply asking a question, instead of manually searching through piles of files for the desired information.</p>
                <p>Overall, Power BI helps organizations to turn data into actionable insights and quickly make informed decisions at scale.</p>
                <p><b className="h3">Case Studies</b></p>

Azure Synapse Analytics analyzes vast data, while Power BI creates interactive visualizations. These tools are powering T-Mobile's 5G journey and bringing the future of connectivity to customers.</p>
                <p>"With Azure security groups, [managing security] became a much easier task. Managing permissions … is easier to manage than going through a traditional security portal,"" says Vardhaman Patil: Senior Business Intelligence Manager at T-Mobile.</p>
                <p><b>Case - 5: New York City Department of Education </b></p>
                <p><b>The New York City Department of Education successfully meets the challenge with the help of Microsoft Azure.</b></p>
                <p>The New York City Department of Education faced a huge challenge when the pandemic hit, affecting its 1.2 million students (about half the population of Arkansas). It was a crazy time.</p>
                <p>To quickly improve its remote learning capabilities, the department built a cloud-based platform using Azure Synapse Analytics, resulting in high performance, easy management, and strong security. The platform helped the department effectively respond to the pandemic and support its students' education.</p>
                <p>"The district used data to give student performance insights to over 100,000 educators and administrators via Power BI Dashboards. This allowed them to gather more detailed information, such as the number of students who logged into different platforms, to principals which was previously not possible," says <b>Zeeshan Anwar:</b> executive director of the district's finances and product engineering.</p>
