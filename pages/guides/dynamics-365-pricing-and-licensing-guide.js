                <p>The days of perpetual licensing have gone where businesses pay huge prices for a solution irrespective of their requirements or usage. Now, Microsoft has simplified the entire licensing and pricing of all its Dynamics 365 solutions to suit the different needs of businesses.</p>
                <p>In this section, we are going to discuss various aspects of Dynamics 365 licensing and their usage.</p>

              <div className="cont-table-inner">
                <p><b>Primary Licensing Model</b></p>
                <p>This is the basic Dynamic 365 licensing model that offers you good clarity to choose the most suitable license as per your requirements. It comes in two different models, which are discussed next:</p>
                <p><b>Per User Licensing</b></p>
                <p>Per-user licensing is like the subscription model, where one license is allotted to one user only. It means the individual license purchased by a user can only access the tools and capabilities of the Dynamics 365 application.</p>
                <p>Applications:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Businesses with Changing Needs: It offers flexibility that allows you to purchase or remove licenses as you will.</li>
                  <li>Organization with Diverse Users: Based on the user role, you can assign the license to the required functionalities.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Per Tenant Licensing</b></p>
                <p>Per-tenant licensing allows users to access the functionalities of the Dynamics 365 solution in a business, irrespective of the number of users. It is a fixed fee, and the license can be accessed by anyone.</p>
                <p>Advantages:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Businesses with an inconsistent number of users: It is a cost-effective option, as several users can access the licenses regardless of their roles.</li>
                  <li>Organizations with a unified work environment: It gives a collaborative approach among users to maximize knowledge sharing and streamline access to data.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Note:</b>  An environment is a unified space or a container to store, manage, and share a business's data.</p>
                <p><b>Assigned Licenses</b></p>
                <p>These are individual user licenses that are assigned to accounts based on their requirements.</p>
                <p><b>User Licenses:</b></p>
                <p>This license grants access to individual users to all tools and functionalities of the Dynamics 365 application, irrespective of the device the user is using. The same license is called an enterprise or professional license when opting for <Link href="/products/microsoft-dynamics-365-sales/"><a>Dynamics 365 Sales</a></Link> and Dynamics 365 Customer Service.</p>
                <p><b>Full User Access License:</b></p>
                <p>A full user license gives full access to a license to the user, whether it is an enterprise license or a professional license. These two licenses must not be mixed in an organization.</p>
                <p><b>Attach Licensing:</b></p>
                <p>This is the most cost-effective way of getting licenses for multiple Dynamics 365 applications at a much lower cost once you purchase a full user license. Such licenses offer the same level of tools and capabilities that a full user license offers.</p>
                <p>Microsoft gives a fixed list of subsequent licenses where it specifies that with the purchase of a full user license of a Dynamics 365 application, you can purchase licenses of other qualifying applications. These solutions are frequently purchased by people in similar roles. And Microsoft has fixed data that specifies the master application and its subsequent qualifying licensing options.</p>

              <div className="iner-pp inner-ppp">

                />
              </div>
              <div className="cont-table-inner">
                <p>The best part about attach licensing is you can buy as many licenses as you want available for that base license.</p>
                <p><b>Note:</b> You can only purchase an attached subsequent license after the purchase of a full user license (not a device license) or base user license. Customers who have purchased a base license from a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) or from MPSA programs cannot purchase an attached license and have to purchase the full user license instead.</p>
                <p><b>Additional User Licenses:</b></p>
                <p>Additional user licenses offer limited Dynamics 365 functionality to a user on a monthly subscription based on their requirements. You It allows users to:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Perform manual data entry tasks</li>
                  <li>Consume reports and data</li>
                  <li>Complete tasks similar to update and modifying data</li>
                  <li>Process specific, complex processes without opting for full user access</li>
                  <li>Device License</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Users can access the Dynamics 365 application through a single licensed device without purchasing any other kind of licensing (full user or additional user). Device licenses can be accessed through shared logins (shared passwords or the same device) or individual logins (personal credentials).</p>
                <p>Shared logins are available for Business Central Device License, Sales Device, Field Service Device, and Customer Service Device.</p>
                <p>Individual logins are available for Business Central Device Licenses and Operations-Device.</p>
                <ul><li>Human Resource Self-Service License</li></ul>
                <p>This license allows users to perform basic HR activities without going for a full user license.</p>
                <ul><li>Operations- Activity License</li></ul>
                <p>This offers you the additional capabilities of a team member license to access a Dynamics 365 solution, but less than a full user license.</p>
                <ul><li>Team Member License</li></ul>
                <p>This license is available for almost all applications of Dynamics 365 and offers read-only access to all data. Users can opt for this license to avail basic functionality to add, modify, and update the data, like updating contacts and expense entries.</p>
                <p><b>Unassigned Licenses</b></p>
                <p>Unassigned licenses are the primary licensing for most of the Dynamics 365 solutions. Such licensing gives access to a feature, service, or full functionalities of Dynamics 365 allotted to the user, device, or tenant level.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Full Product Access</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Full product access licensing is the primary licensing option of the few Dynamics 365 solutions offered on a per-tenant basis only. These applications include <Link href="/products/microsoft-dynamics-365-marketing/"><a>Dynamics 365 Marketing</a></Link> and Dynamics 365 Customer Insights.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Cross-Application Access</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This license provides access to Dynamics 365 applications in some situations. This includes the application, like the Dynamics 365 Operations - Order Lines License.</p>
                <ul><li>Additional capacity</li></ul>
                <p>Most of the Dynamics 365 products come with capacity entitlements using different parameters that include data storage, transaction volume, customer profiles, and case routing requests. Some of the functions or parameters in Dynamics 365 come with a base user license. You can avail yourself of this license to increase the specific entitlement to support your business requirements.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>With each base user license, you will get the default subscription capacity per tenant.</li>
                  <li>You need to buy a capacity license for at least one year that comes with standard annual allowances (as per product). All capacities allotted per month can be used yearly, regardless of the allotment.</li>
                  <li>You can share the Dataverse capacity between the following Dynamics 365 solutions: Sales, Customer Service, Field Service, Finance, Supply Chain Management, Human Resources, Commerce, Project Operations, Business Central Essentials, and Business Central Premium.</li>
                  <li>Capacity add-on licenses are based on a single tenant and are not linked to any specific user. Such add-on licenses are only available to customers with a valid base license for the specific product.</li>
                  <li>You can share the database and file storage capacities with Finance, Supply Chain Management, Commerce, Human Resources, and Project Operations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Assigned Licenses</b></p>
                <p>The assigned license is available for some of the Dynamics 365 solutions in three options, which are:</p>
                <ul><li><b>Professional License</b></li></ul>
                <p>Professional licensing offers limited and simplified capabilities and is suitable for users. This is generally used in small businesses with less complex operations.</p>
                <ul><li><b>Enterprise License</b></li></ul>
                <p>This is standard licensing for some Dynamics 365 products. It is for users who want to access the entire business and deal with complex business operations using the advanced functionalities of Dynamics 365. An enterprise license is available for the below Dynamics 365 solutions:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Sales Enterprise</li>
                  <li>Customer Service Enterprise</li>
                  <li>Field Service</li>
                  <li>Human Resources</li>
                  <li>Finance</li>
                  <li>Supply Chain Management</li>
                  <li>Commerce</li>
                  <li>Project Operations</li>
                  <li>Business Central Premium</li>
                  <li>Business Central Essentials</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Note:</b> A user can only access the Enterprise or Professional license for a Dynamics 365 solution. </p>
                <p><b>Note:</b>   A business can use a blend of assigned or unassigned licenses to justify their Dynamics 365 requirements. When you purchase a license, it will assign you non-perpetual rights (no-buyout rights) to use one or more Dynamics 365 applications with cloud-based deployment only.</p>

                <p>Dynamics 365 Customer Insights â€“ Data: It gives a unified view of customers, leveraging CDP (customer data platform), AI, and BI to offer real-time insights utilizing different data sources. Also, it tracks customer preferences, interactions, trends, and behavior for accurate insights.</p>
                <p>Generally, it is licensed per tenant and can be installed in four different work environments. It means a single tenant license can access both applications.</p>
                <p>Both solutions come with a standard capacity defined by Interacted People (Active Contacts) and Unified People (Profiles).</p>

                  <li>Interacted People: These are the contacts who have interacted with the business through your marketing efforts. Such communication channels include SMS, email, and form submission. We can also treat Interacted People as recurring customers. The base capacity for Customer Insights â€“ Journey is 10K interacted people. If the customers didnâ€™t interact with the business in the previous 12 months, they donâ€™t count against the base limit. Also, you will get 10x the interacted people limit in monthly interactions.</li>
                  <li>Unified People: These are the unique audience that interacts with the business. It can be identified after combining data from multiple resources. The base capacity for Customer Insights â€“ Insights is 100K unified people.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Note:</b> Calling and text messaging services are not included in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights. You will need to integrate Microsoft ACS (Azure Communication Services) or a third-party solution to send and receive messages from customers.</p>

                <p><b>Dual use rights</b></p>
                <p>Dual-use rights allow users to access the Dynamics 365 license in two places simultaneously. You can deploy Dynamics 365 on the cloud as well as on-premises servers or in multiple environments.</p>
                <p>This will help you when you are trying to move from on-premises to cloud deployment and have to access both deployments altogether for successful <Link href="/our-services/dynamics-365-implementation-services/"><a>Dynamics 365 implementation</a></Link>. Also, you can avail of dual user rights for testing purposes.</p>
                <p>A full user license has the right to access CAL to manage on-premises workloads. Dual use rights are non-perpetual entities and will expire when the cloud subscription license expires.</p>
                <p>When you access dual use rights for system migration or testing purposes, Microsoft technical support will assist you in a successful deployment, but this support isnâ€™t included with on-premises deployment. </p>
                <p><b>Multiplexing</b></p>
                <p>Microsoft doesnâ€™t allow multiplexing at any cost. Multiplexing refers to a strategy of using hardware, software, or tools to pool connections or reduce the number of actual users or devices that access Dynamics 365.</p>
                <p>Any user who wants to access the Dynamics 365 set of solutions must be properly licensed based on the requirements.</p>
