                <h2>Dynamics 365 Business Central Vs Finance: An Overview</h2>
                <p>
                  Leveraging innovative technologies like machine learning, big
                  data analytics, and the cloud to advance your organization's
                  growth is no longer a hefty job. It is now easy with modern
                  ERP and CRM software applications since they are powered by
                  these techs to help you make informed decisions based on the
                  collected data - essential to keep the organization ahead of
                  the curve.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Thus, choosing an ERP that favors your business processes can
                  be disastrous if not done right. So, to assist you in avoiding
                  ERP failure and help choose the ERP fit for you, we have
                  compiled the list of key differentiators between two popular
                  ERP modules from Microsoft: Dynamics 365 Business Central and
                  Dynamics 365 Finance.

                      appropriate ERP."{" "}

                      problems and avoid all hassles by revealing the specific
                      areas that are painful to address with the help of a
                      trustworthy vendor like <Link href="/"><a></a></Link> and make the right
                      choice.

                    <p>
                      <b>Myth #2</b>: “With a detailed RFP, you will be able to
                      eliminate products and/or vendors that don't fit your
                      needs.”{" "}

                      <b>Busted:</b> This might be true, but few like us are
                      transparent about RFPs. We help you make the final
                      decision and ensure that you do not miss anything.

                      <b>Myth #3</b>: "In place of investing in best-of-breed
                      tech-stacks, it is recommended to customize/configure your
                      ERP system for optimal functionality."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b>Busted:</b> Customization is all about coding. Some use
                      the word "customization", and others use "configuration".
                      None means the alterations in the whole ERP module.

                       <p>Several factors determine the cost of the system. Dynamics 365 Business Central, for example, is about 35% of D365 Finance in terms of implementation cost. In this regard, Dynamics 365 Business Central offers a much more affordable solution.<br /><br />However, if you consider other factors like licensing, Business Central can be a more expensive deal than Dynamics 365 Finance. Therefore, the system's cost will vary depending on a variety of factors and the number of configurations.</p>

                     <p>The selection of an ERP system has no direct relationship with the size of your company. It is mostly proportional to your business requirements. Business Central is suitable for small to medium businesses (SMBs/SMEs) housing less complex business mechanisms. While Dynamics 365 Finance leans toward businesses that have larger and more complex operations to manage.  <br />
                        <br />However, there may come a time when some small and medium size companies would run a business with complex business ops, then choosing Dynamics 365 Finance can be the right decision.</p>
