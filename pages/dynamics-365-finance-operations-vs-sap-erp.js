                  Because it involves big investments, strategic planning, and
                  risks. Moreover, a lack of awareness or the wrong

                <h3>SAP ERP for Finance</h3>
                <p>
                  SAP has been the leader in the ERP software market since the
                  1970s. It has a significant market presence, and yet appears
                  to be suited 'only' for multinational corporations (MNCs) and
                  small and mid-size businesses.
                </p>
                <p>
                  SAP often claims to deliver on most business streams;
                  nonetheless, it is more expensive than other ERP variants. SAP
                  ERP for Finance can be an alternative if you are up for
                  consistency, basic customizations, use of third-party apps,
                  and straightforward setup.
