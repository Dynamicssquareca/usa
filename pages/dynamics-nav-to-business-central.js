                <h2>Do I Need to Upgrade to Business Central?</h2>
                <p>As we know, Microsoft has already ended the mainstream support for Dynamics NAV 2018 at the beginning of 2023. Right now, Dynamics NAV 2018 is eligible to receive only security updates until the end of the extended support period. </p>
                <p>As a matter of course, there will be no mainstream or extended support for older versions than that of Dynamics NAV 2018. </p>
                <p>Once the extended support is over, businesses running Dynamics NAV 2018 or older versions will no longer be getting any system or security updates to keep up with ever-evolving business demands. Using the outdated ERP system will ultimately impact the overall business performance.</p>
                <p>However, upgrading to Microsoft Dynamics Business Central is not mandatory but is highly recommended for growing businesses. If you are still using NAV, you may miss out on:</p>

                <p>You might find the initial implementation cost to be expensive, but in the long run, <strong>Dynamics 365 Business Central is expected to give 162% ROI</strong> as per <a href="https://download.microsoft.com/download/f/8/b/f8b3d4db-d2b6-4357-bfc4-a1fdafd8b993/TEI_of_Microsoft_Business%20Central_FINAL.pdf" rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>Total Economic Impact from Forrester Consulting</a>. This number is huge and lets the business invest the money in the right direction rather than maintaining an existing system.</p>
                <p>This ROI fact is impressive and shows the potential of upgrading to Business Central from NAV. Besides, it is also a strong indicator for businesses to invest money in the right direction rather than maintaining an existing system.</p>
                <p>Also, delaying the upgrade can increase the overall <Link href="/our-services/dynamics-365-implementation-services/"><a>Dynamics 365 implementation</a></Link> cost by 15%, as Microsoft releases the updates twice a year, which makes the NAV to Business Central upgrade a bit complicated.</p>
                <p>Once you upgrade to Dynamics Business Central, Microsoft will take care of all updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and patch installation automatically, without any cost.</p>
                <p><span>If you have to upgrade tomorrow, why not start the process today? This smart decision will save a lot of money and resources that can be invested in business growth.</span></p>
